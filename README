Notes about the PSR-800 scanner:

1)
	it does not support remote control, even a little.  Secret source says so.  Buy a different radio. Please.
You should not support this silliness. Radios should support bare minimum remote control.  Particularly if it's just a
minor firmware difference from the psr-310/psr-410 radio.   Don't buy this radio.  Really.   I'm providing this software
to help other idiots like me that have _already_ bought this stupid thing and now have found they can't really do much
useful stuff with it when plugged into the computer.

2)
	The serial port only supports CCdump output.  It does this on windows just fine.  It's using a composite CDC ACM IAD
descriptor, which means it cannot hook to a Macintosh (no IAD support yet. 2011. really.)... It SHOULD work on Linux, but I cannot
get it to be recognized at all.. Error -22 when probing the thing.  Someone at GRE did the bare minimum required to get Windows
to see it (typical) and called it a day.   Perhaps that will change someday.  I don't have much hope, and i'll probably have
bought a new radio by then anyway. See Item #1 above.

So, what does this tool do?

When you plug in your scanner, it creates a usb attached storage device. (the sd card).  This DOES work on all three platforms,
windows, linux, and OSX  (with the caveat that it's hard to unmount the device without an error dialog on OSX, but it's FAT
underneath, so it doesn't matter. just yank the wire.)

Anyway, this tool will copy out all the recorded audio files in the REC/ directory, and clean that directory up
so the scanner is no longer full of recorded data.   They're sunau files, mostly.  we can do a lot with them.
I provide the metadata in a dictionary, so..
